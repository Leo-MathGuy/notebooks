The rules are:\n\n1. If a player's guess is less than 1 or greater than 100, say \"OUT OF BOUNDS\"\n2. On a player's first turn, if their guess is\n * within 10 of the number, return \"WARM!\"\n * further than 10 away from the number, return \"COLD!\"\n3. On all subsequent turns, if a guess is \n * closer to the number than the previous guess return \"WARMER!\"\n * farther from the number than the previous guess, return \"COLDER!\"\n4. When the player's guess equals the number, tell them they've guessed correctly *and* how many guesses it took!\n\nYou can try this from scratch, or follow the steps outlined below. A separate Solution notebook has been provided. Good luck!\n"},{"metadata":{"scrolled":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#Made by Leonid Iudakov 2021\n\n#Import the library\nfrom random import *\n\n#Make variables\nnum = randint(1, 100)\ni = 0\n\n#Main Loop\nwhile True:\n    try: #Get guess\n        guess = int(input(\"Please enter your guess from 1 to 100: \"))\n    except ValueError: #Show error if not integer\n        print(\"ONLY DIGITS!\")\n        continue\n    \n    #Increase guess counter\n    i+=1\n    \n    if guess < 1 or guess > 100: #Out of bounds error\n        print(\"OUT OF BOUNDS\")\n        i-=1\n        continue\n        \n    elif guess == num: #If right, show guesses and congrats\n        print(f\"You got it!
